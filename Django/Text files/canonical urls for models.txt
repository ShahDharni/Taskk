What is Canonical urls??
A canonical URL is the URL of the best representative page from a group of duplicate pages, according to Google.
For example, if you have two URLs for the same page (such as example.com? dress=1234 and example.com/dresses/1234 ), Google chooses one as canonical.


Canonical Urls used for models?
You can use the post_detail URL that you have defined in the previous section to build the canonical URL for Post objects.
The convention in Django is to add a get_absolute_url() method to the model that returns the canonical URL of the object. 
For this method, we will use the reverse() method that allows you to build URLs by their name and passing optional parameters.


Why we are using strftime ?
Note that we are using the strftime() function to build the URL using month 
and day with leading zeros. We will use the get_absolute_url() method in 
our templates.
