When Querysets are evaluated?
You can concatenate as many filters as you like to a QuerySet and you will not hit 
the database until the QuerySet is evaluated. Querysets are only evaluated in the 
following cases:
• The first time you iterate over them
• When you slice them. for instance: Post.objects.all()[:3]
• When you pickle or cache them
• When you call repr() or len() on them
• When you explicitly call list()on them
• When you test it in a statement such as bool(), or , and, or if




get_queryset() is the method that returns the QuerySet to be executed. 
We use it to include our custom filter in the final QuerySet.
 We have defined our custom manager and added it to the Post model; we can now use it to perform queries. 
For example, we can retrieve all published posts whose title starts with Who using:
Post.published.filter(title__startswith='Who')
