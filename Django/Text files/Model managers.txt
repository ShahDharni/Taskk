Adding Custom Manager 
There are two ways to add managers to your models: You can add extra manager methods or modify initial manager QuerySets. 
The first one turns up something like Post.objects.my_manager()and the later like Post.my_manager.all().
Our manager will allow us to retrieve posts using Post.published.


 
objects=models.Manager() #--default manager
published=Published_Manager() #-- Our custom manager
