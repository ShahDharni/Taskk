A Django view is just a Python function that receives a web request and returns a web response. 
Inside the view goes all the logic to return the desired response. 
First, we will create our application views, then we will define an URL pattern for each view; and finally, we will create HTML templates to render the data generated by the views. 
Each view will render a template passing variables to it and will return an HTTP response with the rendered output.
