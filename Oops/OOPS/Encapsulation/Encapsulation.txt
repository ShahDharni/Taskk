Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.


# Access Modifiers :-
Public Access Modifier - It is the default for member variables and methods for a class. Here, the data member and methods are accessible outside or inside of the class.
 
Private Access Modifier -  A double underscore prefix denotes protected members before their name. Here, the data member and methods are accessed only within the class.
 
Protected Access Modifier -  A single underscore prefix denotes protected members before their name. 
Here, the data member and methods are accessed only within the class and the class that is inherited from the protected class.
