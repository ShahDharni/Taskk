1. Class:- A Class is a collection of objects. It contains the blueprint or prototype associated from which the objects are being created.
2. Object :- Object is an entity that are associated with state and behavior. 
   (a) State - represented by attributes and reflects the properties 
   (b) Behavior -represented by methods and also reflects the response of object to other object.
   (c) Identity - Gives unique name to object and also enables to interact with other object.





self: Class must have first extra parameter. We do not have to give value to this parameter when we call the function. If we have a method that takes no arguments then also we have to pass one argument that is self. 
__init__: init is used to initialize the function.
