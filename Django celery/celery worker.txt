When you start celery worker on the command line via celery --app you just start a supervisior process.
The celery worker itself does not process any task.
It spwans the child processes(or threads) and deals with all the book-keeping stuffs.
The child processes(or threads) execute the actual task.
This child processes are also known as execution pool.
The size of the execution pool determines the number of task your celery worker can process.
