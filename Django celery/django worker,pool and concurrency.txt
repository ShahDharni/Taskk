Worker - Pool - Concurrency
When you start the celery worker, you have to specify the autoscale, Pool and Concurrency in the command.

pool - decides who will actually performs the task - thread, child process, worker itself or else.

Concurrency - Concurrency will decide the size of the pool.

autoscale - to dynamically resize the pool based on the load. The autoscaler adds more pool processes when there is work to do,  and starts removing processes when the work load is low.

To load the celery the command line :-
celery -A django_celery_project.celery worker --pool=solo --concurrency=5 --autoscale=10,3 -l info  (after -A we have to write project name) (in autoscale 10 is max and 3 is min)
