Difference between send and send_robust :-

send() does not catch any exceptions raised by receivers, it only allows errors to propogate. Thus not all the receivers may be notified of a signal in the face of an error.

send_robust() catches all the errors derived from Python's exception class, and ensures all receivers are notiifed of the signal. 
If an error occurs the error instance is returned in the tuple pair for the receiver that raised the error.
