Built in signals

Django provides a set of Built in signals that let user notified by Django itself of certain actions.

Login and Logout signals - The auth framework uses the following signals that can be used for notification when user logs in or logout.

django.contrib.auth.signals - from where we can import signals.
1.user_logged_in(sender,request,user) - Sent when a user logged in successfully.
where,
sender - The class of the user that just logged in.
request - Current Http Request instance.
instance - The user instance that just logged in.

2.user_logged_out(sender,request,user)  - Sent when the logged out method called.
where,
sender - The class of the user that just logged out or None if the user is not authenticated.
request - Current Http Request instance.

3. user_login_failed(sender,credentials,request) - Sent when the user failed to login successfully.
where,
sender - The name of the module used for authentication.
credentials - A dictionary of keyword arguments containing the user credentials that were passed to authenticate() or your own custom authentication backends. Credentials matching a set of "sensitive" patterns (including passwords) will not be sent in the clear as a part of the signal.
