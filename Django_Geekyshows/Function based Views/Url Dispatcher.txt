path(route,view,kwargs=None, name=None)

Path :- It returns an element for inclusion in urlpatterns.

where the route arguments should be string or gettext_lazy() that contains a Url pattern. The string may contain angle brackets <username> to capture part of the url and send it as a  keyword arguments to the view.
The angle bracket may contain converter specification like the int part of the <int:id> which limit the characters matched and may also change the type of the variable passed to view function.
For eg <int:id> matches a string of decimal digits and converts the value to an int 

The view argument is a view function or the result of as_view() for class based views.

It can also be django.urls.include()

The kwargs allows to pass the additional arguments to view function or method. It should be dictionary.
