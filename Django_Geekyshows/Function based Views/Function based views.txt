A function based views is a python function that takes Web request and returns Web response. 

The response can be the HTML contents of a web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or XML document or an image or anything.

Each view function takes an Http request object as its first parameter,

The view returns an Http Request object that contains the generated Response. Each view function is responsible for returning an Http Response object.

We will call these function as view function, view or view function of an application.

Syntax: def func(request): (Http Request Object) 
          return Http Response(post/list/html) (Http Response Object)


where http response is a class which is in django.http module so we have to import it before using HttpResponse.
