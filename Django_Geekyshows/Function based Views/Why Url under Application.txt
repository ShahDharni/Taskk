To define url at project level for all the apps

This approach increases the dependency of applications in project which means if we want to use particular application in other project it might create issues.

Our each application should be independent or less dependent on project so we sholud use our application in another project easily without worrying about urls.py folder avaiable in project folder.

Benefits of using URL under application:-
Reduces the dependency of application

Enhance the performance of the application

Reusability of the application becomes easy
